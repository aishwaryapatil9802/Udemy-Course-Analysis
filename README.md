Free courses garner the highest subscribers, constituting a significant 30.41% of the total. This preference suggests a strong inclination towards no-cost learning. Following this, courses priced at $20 and $200 each have a share of 11% in subscribers. The data implies a trend where a substantial portion of the audience prefers free courses, while a notable segment is willing to invest in both moderately and higher-priced content

The subject with the highest number of reviews is "Web Development," constituting a substantial 74% of the total reviews.

In free courses, the total content duration is 690 hours with an average duration of 2.21 hours. On the other hand, paid courses have a total content duration of 14,370 hours with an average duration of 4.27 hours. Additionally, the review count also supports this trend ,with paid courses receiving significantly more reviews at 442.68k compared to 132k for free courses.

In summary, my analysis indicates that creators invest less time in free courses while dedicating more time to the creation of paid courses.

Moreover, a level-wise analysis reinforces this observation, clearly indicating that the average duration of free courses is consistently lower than that of paid courses across all levels. This suggests a consistent pattern where creators allocate less time to free courses compared to their paid counterparts at every course level.
